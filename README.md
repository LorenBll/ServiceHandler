# PortHandler

PortHandler is a local web service registry. It solves the problem of registering named services on the local machine so clients can look up each other by name, port, and metadata through a small HTTP API.

## About
PortHandler is scoped to service registration and discovery on the local device. The service binds to `127.0.0.1` on port `49155` and rejects API calls that do not come from the local device. Registered clients are kept in memory and persisted to `resources/clients.json`. A background health-check thread pings registered clients every 30 seconds and removes unreachable ones.

## Setup
1. Install the Python dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Review `resources/configuration.json` if you want to change the port.
3. Leave the project structure intact so the service can find `resources/` and `src/`.

## Run
1. Windows: run `scripts\run.bat`.
2. Unix-like systems: run `bash scripts/run.sh`.
3. Manual: run `python src/main.py` from the project root.

## API Endpoints

All endpoints are local-device only. Requests from non-local addresses are rejected with:
- `403` -> `{ "error": "Local device access only." }`
- All endpoints also support `HEAD` and `OPTIONS`.
- API responses use `Connection: close` (non-persistent connections).

### `POST /api/register` (also `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`)
Registers a new client service and returns a SHA-256 hash. Before registering, PortHandler probes the new client's health endpoint (`/api/health`) to confirm it is reachable.

- Body (JSON object):
	- `name` (string, required): name for the client service. If a client with the same name is already registered, PortHandler checks whether that existing client is still alive. If it is, registration is rejected. If it is not, the stale registration is replaced.
	- `port` (number, required): port number the client listens on (1-65535).
	- `starting_script` (string, optional): path to the client's startup script.
	- `pid` (number, optional): process ID of the running client.
- Returns:
	- `201` -> `{ "hash": "<sha256-hash>" }`
	- `400` -> `{ "error": "A non-empty name is required." }`
	- `400` -> `{ "error": "A port number is required." }`
	- `400` -> `{ "error": "Port must be a number between 1 and 65535." }`
	- `400` -> `{ "error": "Client health endpoint is not reachable." }`
	- `409` -> `{ "error": "A client with name '...' is already registered." }` (only returned when the existing client is still alive)

### `POST /api/question` (also `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`)
Looks up another client's port by name. The asker must be a registered client.

- Body (JSON object):
	- `hash` (string, required): SHA-256 hash of the asking client.
	- `name` (string, required): name of the target client to look up.
- Returns:
	- `200` -> `{ "name": "<target-name>", "port": <target-port> }`
	- `400` -> `{ "error": "Your hash is required to ask a question." }`
	- `400` -> `{ "error": "The name of the target client is required." }`
	- `404` -> `{ "error": "Asker is not a registered client." }`
	- `404` -> `{ "error": "No client found with name '...'." }`

### `DELETE /api/unregister` (also `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`)
Unregisters a client by its hash.

- Body (JSON object):
	- `hash` (string, required): SHA-256 hash of the client to unregister.
- Returns:
	- `200` -> `{ "status": "unregistered", "hash": "<hash>" }`
	- `400` -> `{ "error": "A hash is required to unregister." }`
	- `404` -> `{ "error": "Hash not found." }`

### `GET /api/health` (also `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`)
Service health check with registration statistics.

- Body: none
- Returns:
	- `200` ->
		```json
		{
			"status": "ok",
			"service": "PortHandler",
			"bind_address": "127.0.0.1",
			"port": 49155,
			"hostname": "workstation-name",
			"registered_clients": 0
		}
		```
